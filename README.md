systemjs-basic-browser-demo
===========================

just a very basic system js project showcasing ES6 and commonJS modules

I have no example for AMD modules, because I have not found a need to include them in my projects.

Also try to place breakpoints in the code-you will find that breakpoints in the ES6 modules don't break. You can work around this issue by placing "debugger" statements in your code. This is not the best solution, but unfortunatelly it will have to do until we have ES6 implemented natively, not through [traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler).
